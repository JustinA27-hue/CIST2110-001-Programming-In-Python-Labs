#Lab 9
# Author:Justin Agosto

"""_summary_

This lab is designed to create a simple web application using streamlit and create a simple Date counter using datetime.
"""

# 1. We will first need to activate and install streamlit.


# 2. Import streamlit here as st and datetime as dt
import streamlit as st
import datetime as dt


# 3. Create a title for your web application. Streamlit has a function for this called title
def title():
    st.title("Date Counter")
    return



# 4. Create a subheader for your web application. Streamlit has a function for this called subheader
def subheader():
    st.subheader("Enter a date and click the button to see how many days until that date.")
    return
# 5. Create a date input for the user to enter a date. Streamlit has a function for this called date_input
# Make sure to save the input into a variable
def date_input():
    date = st.date_input("Enter a date")
    return date
# 6. Create a button for the user to click. Streamlit has a function for this called button
# Make sure to save the button click into a variable
def button():
    button = st.button("Click me")
    return button
# 7. Create a function that will calculate the number of days until the date entered by the user.
# You will need to use the datetime library for this.
# You will need to convert the user input into a datetime object.
# You will need to get the current date and convert it into a datetime object.
# You will need to subtract the current date from the user input date.
# You will need to return the number of days.
# The function should take in a datetime.date as a parameter.
# The function should return an integer.
# The function should be called calculate_days
def calculate_days(date):
    today = dt.date.today()
    days = date - today
    return days.days


# 8. Create an app function that will run the web application.
# Check if the button has been clicked, then call the calculate_days function and pass in the date entered by the user. Use a try except block to catch any errors.
# Save the result into a variable.
# Print out the result.
def app():
    title()
    subheader()
    date = date_input()
    button_click = button()
    if button_click:
        try:
            days = calculate_days(date)
            st.write(days)
        except:
            st.write("Please enter a valid date")
    return

# 9. Run the web application by typing streamlit run Lab9.py in the terminal.
# 10. Enter a date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD and click the button.
# 11. Check to see if the number of days until the date entered is correct.
# 12. If the number of days is correct, then you have completed the lab.
# 13. If the number of days is incorrect, then you will need to debug your code.
